# shmbuf - Shared Memory Circular Buffer in C

## Overview

Two C programs that implement a circular buffer using shared memory, designed for inter-process communication (IPC) between a producer and a consumer. This shared memory circular buffer is a common synchronization mechanism in concurrent programming, allowing efficient data exchange between different processes.
